To create a GitHub project for tracking stock prices, you can use Node.js along with a stock price API, such as Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance. You'll also set up a simple web server to display the stock prices. Below is an outline of the project structure and the necessary files to get started.

Project Structure
Code
stock-tracker/
├── index.js
├── package.json
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── routes/
│   └── stock.js
└── views/
    └── stock.ejs

1. package.json
First, create a package.json file to manage your project's dependencies.

2. index.js
Create an index.js file to set up the Express server and define routes.

3. routes/stock.js
Create a routes/stock.js file to handle fetching stock prices from an API.

4. public/index.html
Create a simple HTML file to allow users to input a stock symbol.

5. views/stock.ejs
Create an EJS template to display the stock information.

Running the Project
Replace YOUR_API_KEY in routes/stock.js with your actual Alpha Vantage API key.
Install the dependencies by running npm install.
Start the server by running npm start.
Now, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser, enter a stock symbol, and see the latest stock price information.
